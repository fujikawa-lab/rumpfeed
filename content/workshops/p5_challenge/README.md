# p5.js Challenge

_This is an introduction to the challenge we're running in partnership with [repl.it](https://repl.it). You can submit your project to the challenge [here](https://hackclub.com/challenge)._


## Boilerplate

Get started with a repl already configured with p5.js and jump straight into coding:

1. Go to [repl.it/@zrl/p5-boilerplate](https://repl.it/@zrl/p5-boilerplate)
2. Click "fork" to make a copy to edit

## More Background / Helpful Links

The prompt for this challenge is to build the coolest website using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

p5.js is a toolkit for building interactive graphics on the website. If you're familiar with [Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)), p5.js is the most popular adaptation of Processing for the web.

I'm personally most inspired by the art people have made with p5.js. Tumblr has a bunch of cool examples at https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/p5js ([click here](http://delirium-lab.com/post/141916684686/sto%C3%AFcloth) to see one of my favorites).

p5.js requires minimal JavaScript knowledge and has a bunch of examples to help get you started: [click here](https://p5js.org/examples/).

Recommendations for getting started experimenting with p5.js:

- [p5.js official tutorial](https://p5js.org/learn/)
- Hack Club workshops:
   - [Geometric pattern](https://hackclub.com/workshops/geometric_pattern) - generate a pattern with p5.js
   - [Dodge](https://hackclub.com/workshops/dodge) - build a basic game w/ p5.js
   - [Bumpteroids](https://hackclub.com/workshops/bumpteroids) - this is my personal favorite, build a clone of the classic Asteroids game w/ p5.js
- [p5.js transformations guide](http://genekogan.com/code/p5js-transformations/)

Can't wait to see what you build!
