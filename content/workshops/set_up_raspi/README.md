## Preparing the SD card

You can download the latest version of Raspbian from [https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)

To burn your image onto your SD card you will need a software called Etcher by Resin.io. Download Etcher from here [https://etcher.io/](https://etcher.io/)

Using an SD card adapter connect the SD card to your computer.

Using Etcher burn the downloaded Raspbian image on to the SD card.

Or you could use the NOOBS (New Out Of the Box) OS image given on the website. It is basically an installer of multiple operating system distributions which includes the Raspbian image. You can also sideload other operating systems using NOOBS.

Just download the file given and extract the contents onto the micro SD card. Pop it inside the micro SD card slot on the Raspberry Pi. Boot it up and select the operating system you want to install. Wait for the OS to install and you are good to go!
